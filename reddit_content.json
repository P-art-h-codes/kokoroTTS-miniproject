Then out of frustration I decided to limit myself to only circles and blue. That's it. And then... boom. Ideas started flowing. Weirdly, having fewer options made me more creative. Here's the thing: Your brain loves solving puzzles but freaks out when there are too many choices. If you say make something cool, it crashes. If you say make something cool but only with triangles, it suddenly wakes up. The dumber the limitation, the better it works. Write a story without using the letter e. Cook with only what's in your fridge right now. Make a PowerPoint where every slide has to be a question. Now I apply this everywhere. At work, for personal projects, even picking my playlist. I set myself a ridiculous rule and magically everything unlocks. So if you're struggling with something creative, stop looking for inspiration. Find yourself a stupid constraint and watch what happens.",

One night I was so frustrated that I started telling myself the most boring story I could think of. Like describing someone doing laundry step by step. I was out in 10 minutes. Here's what I learned: Your brain needs something to focus on, not nothing. When you try to think of nothing, it panics and starts generating random thoughts. But give it a boring task and it calms down. The key is making it really mundane. I usually go with someone making a sandwich. Every tiny detail. Getting the bread from the bag, opening the jar, spreading the peanut butter slowly, wiping the knife, closing the jar. Sometimes I do someone grocery shopping. Walking through the automatic doors, grabbing a cart, going down each aisle, picking up milk, checking the expiration date. The story has to be boring enough that your brain doesn't get excited, but detailed enough that it stays occupied. No drama, no interesting characters, just pure mundane stuff. I've been doing this for months and I rarely stay awake more than 15 minutes now. It's like giving your brain a boring movie to watch until it falls asleep.",

Or research business ideas for years without launching a business. The preparation becomes a substitute for the actual thing.

Every time you choose to research more instead of start, you're training yourself to delay. Every time you wait for the perfect moment, you're practicing avoidance. This whole pattern of self-sabotage through \"preparation\" is something that gets broken down in a ebook called \"What You Chose Instead\" by Ryder Eubanks ( you can find it on \"ekselense\") I think it‚Äôs the best way to learn more about this right now since it‚Äôs explained in a really clear, easy-to-understand way. It stands out compared to everything else I‚Äôve seen. The uncomfortable truth is that most \"preparation\" is just fear wearing a responsible mask. You don't need more information. You need to start with what you have. You don't need perfect conditions. You need to move while conditions are messy. The person you want to become exists on the other side of doing things before you feel ready. But your brain keeps convincing you that readiness is a prerequisite instead of a byproduct. Action creates clarity, not the other way around. Stop preparing to live and start living imperfectly.",

Stop saying \"I have to\" and start saying \"I choose to.\" Sounds simple but it's a total mindset shift. You realize you have way more control over your responses than you think. 2. Begin with the end in mind. Before jumping into any project or even your day, ask yourself what success looks like. I started doing this with meetings and it cut my time in half. 3. Put first things first. The urgent/important matrix changed everything. Most \"urgent\" stuff isn't actually important, and most important stuff isn't urgent. Focus on important but not urgent tasks. 4. Think win-win. Instead of trying to come out on top in every situation, look for solutions where everyone benefits. Made my workplace relationships way less stressful. 5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood. Listen to actually understand, not just to respond. This one improved my relationships more than anything else. 6. Synergize. Two people working together can achieve more than two people working separately. Sounds obvious but I was always trying to do everything myself. 7. Sharpen the saw. Take care of yourself physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. You can't pour from an empty cup. The book is pretty dense but these concepts are surprisingly practical once you start applying them. Anyone else read this? Which habit hit you the hardest? Btw, I used¬†Dialogue¬†to listen to podcasts on this book (The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Peopl), it was an amazing way to recap everything I learnt. Hope you like this post!",

Because I had a 3.3 GPA and didn't think about college earlier, I have to start at community college to save money. Because I didn't save my earnings, I have to get loans instead of paying for tuition myself. Because I didn't \"be a teenager\" and go out with friends when I was younger, I am sheltered. it's to the point where peers treat me like a baby. it's embarrassing. i'm learning from my mistakes now. i'm going out with friends more, being more productive, and making an effort to save. but, that doesn't mean it still doesn't hurt. I wish I was a better teen so my young adulthood wouldn't be spent making up for faulty social skills and working my butt off to pay for school.",

They build postive ego and boosts your confidence and most importantly it fills the \"boring\" space in your life.  Give yourself your own daily missions.

Last year I found a desire to build software and apps. Ever since pursuing this, I have felt a sense of purpose as opposed to trying different morning routines.
